# Timer & random number generator

## Countdown Timer
This is a very simple countdown timer.

To run, just open `index.html` in any browser.

## Coin Flip

`randomfrombool.js` returns a pseudo random number taking only a random boolean and the current time to add some (not much) chaos to the equation.

I was inspired by [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) article and with more time and analysis, I plan to actually implement it.
